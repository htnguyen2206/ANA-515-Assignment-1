We have data about 100,798 individuals killed by guns. Only 15,687 are older than 65. The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

# Gun deaths by age

```{r youth-dist, echo = FALSE}
youth %>% 
ggplot(aes(age)) + 
geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1) 
```

# Gun deaths by race

```{r race-dist, echo = FALSE}
youth %>% 
ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race) %>% fct_rev())) + 
geom_bar() + coord_flip() + 
labs(x = "Victim race") 
```
